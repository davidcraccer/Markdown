#### About Me

My name is  **David Svoboda** and I am a front-end developer.  I current work as a _Front End Engineer_ annd a _Parkour Trainer_ at Pfeffersport. In my free time I play chess on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) ♟️.

I love to travel to connect with new people, with the locals especially to learn more about their _language_ and _culture_.
